Docker Images
----------------
[![Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/gokit/docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gokit/docker#)

This repository is a collection of useful docker based image files which can be generated for use in tests or for building/compiling
related programs. They exists as base to be used for such function, the generated images for some are rather large and not advisable 
to be used in production but only for testing, developing or pilot deployments.


## Building

Running the `make build` command will be all available docker files using provided
version in tag and user name to be used for tagging and pushing to docker hub.

```bash
VERSION=0.0.1 DUSER=wombat make build
```

```bash
VERSION=0.0.1 DUSER=wombat make push
```

You can generate builds for custom go versions and custom google components for gcloud docker
images by customizing the `GOVERSION` and `COMPONENTS` environment variables to your needs.

```bash
GOVERSION=1.11.2 COMPONENTS=pubsub-emulator make default
```

The above only builds all images for the go version `1.11.2` and only the gcloud 
component `pubsub-emulator`.

The `GOVERSION` and `COMPONENTS` make variables can be set to list items which are strings 
seperated by space like below:

```bash
COMPONENTS = app-engine-go cbt bigtable datalab cloud-datastore-emulator gcd-emulator cloud-firestore-emulator pubsub-emulator cloud_sql_proxy emulator-reverse-proxy cloud-build-local docker-credential-gcr kubectl GOVERSION = 1.11.2 1.11.1 1.11 1.10 1.9 1.8 1.7 make default
```

The command above will build all seperated versions and components in a loop accordingly.
